    <h2>Dawn Cardwell Dominique</h2>
      <p><b>Dawn Cardwell Dominique is a successful 54 year old pediatrician, with her medical degree from Columbia University and a soon to be 5 year breast cancer survivor. She is also my mother, and this is her breast cancer story. She was diagnosed with stage 2A breast cancer on November 26, 2013, while sitting in her work office. This news would be a shock to anyone however; Dawn took a deep breath in and took on her cancer with faith. My mother experienced many changes during her journey including, pain in teeth, loss of appetite, taste and smell changes and the loss of all of her hair. Continuing normal life was difficult while all these physical changes were occurring, however my mother decided not to dwell in her disease. It was the support of family, friends and guidance of goad that lead Dawn through chemotherapy, radiation and a double mastectomy. Today, Dawn is a symbol of strength for women and men going through breast cancer. She proved that breast cancer can be beaten head on with a positive attitude, faith, and a strong support group.</b></p>

    <h2>Gigi Swan</h2>
      <p><b>Gigi Swan, my maternal grand aunt was diagnosed with an early stage breast cancer. She had recently divorced her husband and her older daughters were away in college. Aunt GiGi, a spiritual woman, lived her life by seeking positive energy around her. She was able to get through surgery and chemotherapy while caring for her teenaged daughter and working. Aunt GiGi looked towards God, Family and friends to help her get through her illness. She died decades later of an unrelated cause.</b> </p>

    <h2>Bea Cardwell</h2>
      <p><b>Bea was diagnosed with a late stage breast cancer and survived longer than what was expected by her physicians. She had a strong family history, with her mother also diagnosed with a late stage breast cancer. She chose to combine traditional breast cancer treatments with a holistic approach through healthy eating and vitamins. Aunt Bea was a true supporter of my mother who was diagnosed after her with an early stage of breast cancer. She became an advocate for breast cancer prevention and chose to share her personal experience with others, as well as the breast cancer knowledge she picked up from her doctors, friends and the internet. Though she lived for only five years after diagnosis, she worked hard to prepare her husband and sons for life without her.</b></p>
