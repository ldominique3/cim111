      <h3>About the Creator</h3>
      <div class="box">
      <p>Hello, my name is Leslie Anne Dominique and I am the creator of short film, “The Breast Cancer Journey of Dawn Cardwell”. I chose to create this the film to honor the documented moments that my mother captured during her breast cancer journey. I have known a number of women in my life who were diagnosed with breast cancer, as it is very common in my family. Upon my mother’s diagnosis, I became very involved in breast cancer outreach. I attended and organized various health fairs, along with running multiple 5ks in honor of breast cancer. I find it to be imperative to tell the stories of the men and women who both survived and fell to breast cancer. I am an 18 year old, sophomore at the University of Miami, studying Broadcast Journalism. I have a true passion in educating about breast cancer and in the future I hope to tell the stories of other Breast Cancer survivors, so that their brave journeys never die.</p>
